# Math Algorithms


Quadratic.py:
A Quadratic equation solver, gets the zeros of a standard form equation.

commandline:
python quadratic.py a b c

ax^2 + bx + c = 0

Cubic.py:
A cubic equation solver, gets the zeros of a stand form equation.

commandline:
python quadratic.py a b c d

ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0

Dividecubic.py:
Divides a cubic equation by a linear equation

commandline:
python quadratic.py a b c d a1 b1

(ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d) / (ax - b)

matrix_solver.py:
A plane intersection calculator that takes 3 planes and calculates the POI.

commandline:
python matrix_solver.py [[a1, b1, c1, d1], [a2, b2, c2, d2], [a3, b3, c3, d3]]

where ax + by + cz = d, each number corresponds to each equation
